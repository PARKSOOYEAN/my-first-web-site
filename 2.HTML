<h2>CSS</h2>
<P>
  Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) are a style language that describes how a markup language is actually displayed . They are mainly used in HTML and XHTML, and can also be used in XML. They are a W3C standard and offer a high degree of freedom in defining layout and styles . The default file name [ 2 ] is style.css .

If markup language (ex: HTML ) is in charge of the body of the website , CSS can be said to be in charge of decorating it like clothes and accessories. In other words, you can make it look like a completely different website by leaving the HTML structure as is and only changing the CSS file .

CSS3 , currently under development, has been enhanced with features that can replace images created with graphic editing programs, such as shadow effects, gradients , and transformations . In addition, various animation features have been added , replacing Adobe Flash to some extent.
