The World Wide Web (WWW, W3) is a worldwide information sharing system that allows people to share information through computers connected to the Internet . It is often simply called the Web . This term is often used synonymously with the Internet, but strictly speaking, they are different concepts. The Web is just a 'service' that operates on the Internet communication network, like e-mail . However, since 1993, the Web has occupied an absolute position in the Internet structure.

It also refers to a transmission method that exchanges images and characters using the HTTP protocol , hypertext , and HTML format on the Internet .</p>
