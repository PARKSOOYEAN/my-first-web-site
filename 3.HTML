<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
  JavaScript is an object-based scripting programming language . It is primarily used in web browsers , and has the ability to access built-in objects of other applications. It is also used for server programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha, later LiveScript, and eventually JavaScript. Although JavaScript shares some similarities with Sun Microsystems' Java in terms of syntax, this is because both languages ​​are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and Java and JavaScript have little direct connection . Aside from the name and syntax, it has more similarities with Self and Scheme than with Java. JavaScript is recognized as the language that best implements the ECMAScript standard specification, and was supported natively in most browsers up to ECMAScript 5 (ES5), but from ECMAScript 6 onwards, it is compiled using a transpiler for browser compatibility .
